        Why Is This Information Important?
      </h2>
      <p>This webpage <em>is</em> intended primarily as a joke, but here is a reason that this type of information is not illegal. My audience, the 'average joe,' would probably react to a webpage such as this one with some kind of extreme emotion: disbelief, distain, even outrage.
